# Flight Price Prediction

This project aims to predict flight prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the "Flights" dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The model is deployed using Streamlit and is available at [https://flight-prediction.streamlit.app](https://flight-prediction.streamlit.app/).

## Data Cleaning

The first step in the project was data cleaning. This involved the following steps:

- Removing duplicate entries from the dataset.
- Applying the `.assign(), .split() & lambda` function wherever needed to create new columns or modify existing ones.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset. This included:

- Analyzing the distribution of features.
- Finding correlations between features to understand their relationships.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection is crucial for building a robust machine learning model. In this project, a pipeline of transformers was used for feature selection. This involved:

- Defining a pipeline of transformers to preprocess the data.
- Selecting the most relevant features for prediction.

## Model Training

The selected features were then used to train a Random Forest Regressor model. This model is known for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and provide accurate predictions.

## Deployment

The complete package, including data preprocessing, model training, and prediction, was deployed using Streamlit. Streamlit is a powerful tool for building interactive web applications with Python.
